# Amiee's Favorite Movie Trailers
- Project for Udacity's Programming Fundamentals with Python Course

<h3>Check to make sure Python is installed:</h3>
Open up your terminal and run:<br>

$ python<br>

This should return some version of Python 2.7. If you are running Python 3.0, you will need to run some sort of virtual environment: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/<br>

If Python is not installed at all, see the documentation here: https://www.python.org

<h3>Clone the Repository:</h3>
Once you are sure Python 2.7 is installed correctly execute the following:

$ git clone https://github.com/amarie401/udacity-movie-trailer-project.git<br>
$ cd udacity-movie-trailer-project

<h3>Execute the program:</h3>
$ python entertainment_center.py

A browser should open on your local machine and and render the HTML template with Pooglia's favorite movies. Click on a movie thumbnail to view the trailer!
